# TriviaGame
This is a trivia game that I initially made for a coding class that I am taking. As the name would imply it is a trivia game, specifically it is a trivia game that revolves around the Warhammer 40,000 universe. It is basically a website that (along with the basic HTML and CSS) uses JavaScript and jQuery to create a timed quiz that allows 15 seconds for a user to answer a question. The page will show the user if they answered correctly or not and give them what the correct answer and an image of the correct answer regardless of if the user got the correct answer or not. At the end of the quiz, the page will show the user how many questions they got right and how many that they got wrong, and will then restart the quiz after about 7 seconds.
