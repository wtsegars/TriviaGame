    <h2 class="index-header">What is WH40K?</h2>
    <p class="text">
        For those who may not know, WH40K is short for Warhammer 40,000 and it is an entire franchise that was created by the UK- 
        based company Games Workshop. The whole primise of WH40K is that it is set in the 41st milinium (hence the name) and is set 
        around humanity's struggle to conquer the milky-way galxey from various xenos (alien) races while struggling to survive from
        internal conflicts (mostly due to the ruinous powers). This universe is a very dystopian one; so much so that the tagline of 
        the series ("In the grim darkness of the 41st milinium/far future, there is only war.") inspired the name of a subgenre of 
        fiction called "Grimdark". WH40K is unique because it combines many elements from science fiction and fantasy, thus labeling 
        it science fantasy. Originally, WH40K was exclusivly a minatures-based tabletop game where 2 or more players would battle 
        each other using armies from various factions from the universe. It has since expanded to other areas such as spin-off board 
        games, a vast amount of literature (which is published from Games Workshop's own publishing company "Black Library"), many 
        video games, and even a CG movie.
